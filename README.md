# 50 Interesting Words
<br>
<br>
Words consist of letters, vowels and consonants, and sometimes even punctuation. However, some combinations of those are better than others. This is my list on which words are better than others. These may not be the best words out of the dictionary, but it will be good competitors in being fascinating.
<br>
<br>
The categories of words will be broken down into 5 sections
<ul> 
  <li> Nouns</li>
  <li>Verbs</li>
  <li>Adjectives</li>
  <li>Adverbs</li>
  <li>Conjuctions</li>
</ul>
Without further ado, let's get started with the words
<br>
<br>
<h2> Nouns</h2>
<br>
We'll start with the classic and reliable nouns. Nothing flashy or grand, these words pack a punch through purely what they are.
No wonder they are very much the subject of our words.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>freedom</li>
  <li>apostle</li>
  <li>president</li>
  <li>possession</li>
  <li>investment</li>
  <li>organization</li>
  <li>negotiation</li>
  <li>midnight</li>
  <li>opportunity</li>
  <li>mitochondria</li>
</ul>
<br>
These are some powerful words and remarkable nouns that can stand for a person, place, or thing. They have so much detail and meaning to them, they leave a remarkable presence in the room.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Verbs</h2>
Verbs are the words that bring life to the sentences. They give words drive and action and really make them work. These words are what bring color to sentences and are the show-stealers.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>wake</li>
  <li>differentiate</li>
  <li>appreciate</li>
  <li>eliminate</li>
  <li>incorporate</li>
  <li>evaluate</li>
  <li>substitue</li>
  <li>administer</li>
  <li>owe</li>
  <li>absorb</li>
</ul>
<br>
I hope we can <em>appreciate</em> the wonderful utility of not only these verbs, but all of the verbs. Howver, I think these verbs are phenominal and are just the kind of words that can really bring a stronger tone to any sentence.
